[Project Overview]

This project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application capable of accurately reading handwritten prescriptions. By leveraging Python, TensorFlow, PyTesseract, OpenCV, and other relevant technologies, the application can effectively extract medicine names from prescription images and provide valuable information to users.

Technologies Used

1) Python: The primary programming language for the project.
TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for training the custom model.
2) PyTesseract: OCR engine for extracting text from images.
3) OpenCV: Computer vision library for image processing tasks.
4) Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques for processing and understanding the extracted text.
5) Machine Learning: Algorithms for training the model and detecting medicine names.

## Features

- Image Input.
- Model Training.
- Text Extraction.
- Image Processing.
- Medicine Name Detection.
